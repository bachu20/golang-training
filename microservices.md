## Creating Microservices with Golang

### Go Microservices (Why & How?)
* Go code compiles to single binaries (cross-platform from cross-compilation)
* Go's ecosystem supports a variety of RPC frameworks
* Go allows efficient software design patterns

### Basic Structure
* configuration file(s) => communication (http, tcp, rpc, etc) => service main code <=> persistence (database)
